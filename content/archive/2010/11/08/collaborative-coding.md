Need:

A way to collaboratively write a piece of code with someone on another computer, including:
<ul>
	<li>Real-time, keystroke-by-keystroke updating as the other person types (a la Google Wave)</li>
	<li>Integration with my editor or IDE of choice (e.g., Vim, Eclipse, DrRacket) so I can run the code at any time. I'm okay with actually writing the code in some other environment (e.g., a web browser).</li>
	<li>Platform independence</li>
</ul>
This could be a cross between <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> (for real file system access), <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> or <a href="http://etherpad.com/">Etherpad</a> (for real-time updates), and <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/skywriter/">Mozilla Skywriter</a> (for platform independence).

Anybody have suggestions?
