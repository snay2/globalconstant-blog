He sits nestled between the window and two harried businessmen,  
Sunk into an uncomfortable beige chair  
One foot planted atop the heating vent on the wall  
A half-read book open in his lap,  
Perused only by shut eyelids.  

The salesman across the aisle is closing the day's last deal  
Which transpires here because  
The children expect him at 6.  
The woman behind him animatedly explicates impending adventures  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to her seat-mate.  
And a man with serene but exhausted comportment  
Gazes fondly, silently  
At no one in particular.  
  
But our friend, couched in the warm sunlight of his wall of glass  
Is napping insistently,  
Head bobbing up and down, up  
And down,  
Tuning his ears only to the ceiling's bold double tone  
And the conductor's scratchy call,  
"Now arriving."  
  
Eventually the voice in the roof will name this man's little town,  
The intermittent nonsense of his dreams will cease,  
The blindly-read book will close,  
And the uncomfortable sunlit perch will discharge its occupant,  
Who will descend groggily to the platform and watch  
As the train roars away.
