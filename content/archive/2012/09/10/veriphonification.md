Perhaps I shouldn't admit this publicly, but I like One Direction's hit, "What Makes You Beautiful". It's catchy and has a positive lay. It also has a niggling logical fallacy:

<blockquote>So c-come on,
You got it wrong.
<strong>To prove I'm right,
I put it in a song.</strong></blockquote>

Here's how this argument plays out:
<ol>
<li>I am a famous singer</li>
<li>Famous singers sing truth <span style="font-size:smaller">(the arguments necessary to deduce #2 from #1 are left as an exercise for the reader.)</smaller></li>
<li>I am singing about your beauty</li>
<li>Therefore, you are beautiful. Q.E.D.</li>
</ol>

I also like Dr. K's neologism, <a href="https://twitter.com/cdknutson/status/245171349495107584">veriphonification</a>.
