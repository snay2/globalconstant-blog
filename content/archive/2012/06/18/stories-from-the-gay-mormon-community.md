Recently, I've come across several stories from the historically reticent minority of homosexuals in the LDS community. Their writing deserves to be read; it has increased my compassion and respect for this misunderstood group.

Here are the stories I've found most inspiring:

- Trevor Cook, who came out to his parents only after moving away to college. The post, written by his father: ["Coming Out as an LDS Parent of a Gay Child"](http://mitchmayne.blogspot.com/2012/06/coming-out-as-lds-parent-of-gay-child.html)
- Two gay men who each have a happy heterosexual marriage: Ty Mansfield (["Living with Same-sex Attraction: Our Story"](http://ldsliving.com/story/68799-our-story-living-with-same-sex-attraction)) and Josh Weed (["Club Unicorn: In which I come out of the closet on our ten year anniversary"](http://www.joshweed.com/2012/06/club-unicorn-in-which-i-come-out-of.html))


A Brigham Young University group called Understanding Same Gender Attraction created a collection of insightful videos interviewing religious gay and lesbian students about their experiences coming to terms with their sexuality. This is the main video:

BYU hosted a panel discussion in April about homosexuality. Read the [Daily Universe article](http://universe.byu.edu/index.php/2012/04/05/department-of-sociology-hosted-gay-panel/) about it or [this blog post](http://chriscarrollsmith.blogspot.com/2012/04/not-even-standing-room-at-byu-gay.html), which gives more detail about the participants.

I'm pleased to see The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints updating its [stance on homosexuality](http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/official-statement/same-gender-attraction) to recognize accepted medical evidence that it is a biological trait, not a misguided choice.
