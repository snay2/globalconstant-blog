A month ago I decided to build a standing desk for my computer at home. By the time I finish my day job, I'm tired of sitting. Here's what I did.

The <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">Standesk 2200</a> caught my attention because it's made from Ikea parts totaling $30: two <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20011413/#/20011408">side tables</a> ($7.99 each), a <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20167961/#/90167477">shelf</a> ($5.99), and two <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/56696109/#/80167473">brackets</a> ($4.00 each). Get a screwdriver, drill, level, and some wood screws (presumably already around the house) and put it together. Here's what mine looks like:

I also put a small lamp behind the monitor for some <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/11/bias-lighting.html">bias lighting</a> and bought a $20 anti-fatigue mat to keep my feet happy.

The built-in desk atop which this contraption sits is already weirdly high (34"), putting the top of the side tables at 52". Even with that, I still needed to put a few books under the monitor to raise it to eye level on my six-foot-something self. The keyboard/mouse tray is mounted 11" up on the table legs. The shelf and books can easily be suited to your height.

So far the standing desk has been a good investment. My lower back bothers me infrequently now (aided by my customary lunchtime walks along the river near my office). It forces me to take breaks more often than I otherwise might, and sitting becomes a welcome relief. I move around more while typing, and of course I can easily, if discreetly, dance to my music.

You can build this setup in its simplest form for $22 and the price of gas for an Ikea trip. If you can spare that (or even the exorbitant $50 I spent), it's worth trying out to see if your posture and comfort improve. And it won't require parting with a small fortune for a <a href="http://www.geekdesk.com/">GeekDesk</a> or <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/07/investing-in-a-quality-programming-chair.html">Aeron chair</a>.
