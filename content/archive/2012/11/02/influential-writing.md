Scott Cowley on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/scottcowley/status/264433138300760064">posits</a> that "You don't earn the title of 'well-read' by reading blog posts and news articles." I mostly agree with his premise. Long-form printed literature is still instrumental in shaping the way we think and act as individuals and as a society. But modern evolutions of writing---blog posts, essays, ebooks---also have intellectually shaping capabilities. They both have place in the library of an educated, well-read citizen.

Here are some of the books that have profoundly influenced my thinking:
<ol>
<li><strong>The Chosen</strong> <em>(Chaim Potok)</em> for its exposition of true friendship and loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>1984</strong> <em>(George Orwell)</em>, ever more relevant an investigation of technology and government and the disaster they can create if left unchecked.</li>
<li><strong>Hamlet</strong> <em>(William Shakespeare)</em>, if not merely for its quotability ("Alas, poor Yorick!"), serves as a tragic warning against greed and revenge.</li>
<li><strong>A Christmas Carol</strong> <em>(Charles Dickens)</em>, a well-known classic with a prominent place on my annual reading list, extols the virtues of empathy and charity.</li>
<li><strong>Walden</strong> <em>(Henry David Thoreau)</em>, which emphasizes the importance of self-reliance, contemplation, and introspection.</li>
</ol>

In the short-form category, these pieces have had a similarly powerful effect on my life:
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.classicreader.com/book/769/1/">The Mansion</a></strong> <em>(Henry van Dyke)</em>, a Christian short story about the proper use of wealth.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/05/buying-happiness.html">Buying Happiness</a></strong> <em>(Jeff Atwood)</em>, which explains how to make you and others happier through wise choices.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://taylormali.com/poems-online/totally-like-whatever-you-know/">Totally like whatever, you know?</a></strong> <em>(Taylor Mali)</em>, which powerfully discusses the need for clear thinking, speaking, and writing. <a href="http://vimeo.com/3829682">This video</a> is the best way to experience the poem.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://danshipper.com/the-regret-fallacy">The Regret Fallacy</a></strong> <em>(Dan Shipper)</em> -- make the best decisions you can and then be happy with them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/302696/">Caring for Your Introvert</a></strong> <em>(Jonathan Rauch)</em>, a guide for introverts (like me) and their loved ones to understand how they think.</li>
</ol>

A book, a play, a poem, a short story, an article, two blog posts, and three novels. Plenty of variety.
