NOTE: This is the original first post on <a href="http://instancevariable.wordpress.com/">Instance Variable</a>. I thought I'd leave it here, for old time's sake.

One of these times I will remember what I had wanted to write on this blog to share with the world.  But for now, I'll just make introductions.

I'm a Latter-day Saint attending Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.  That whole experience has given me much food for thought, and perhaps I will write some of that here.

The title of this blog [my <a href="http://instancevariable.wordpress.com/">other blog</a>] comes from a programming contest I was in a few years ago with the BYU ACM (Association for Computing Machinery).  I was the only programmer on the team of two, so we didn't do very well.  But that was the name I chose for the team.  It's a programming term that nobody would actually use.  (It has to do with object-oriented programming.)

And the title of this post comes from the lesson in my Old Testament class this afternoon.  [Bro. Wilson](http://rsc.byu.edu/authors/wilson-keith-j) mentioned that the correct translation for the first verse of Genesis 1 is "in a beginning," not "in the beginning."  Eternity has no beginning and end, but this earth had a beginning.
