I've been using <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> for nine months now and have enjoyed it immensely.  I'm a computer geek anyway, so linux is the perfect toy for me.  I love the customizability and control linux gives me.  I can open up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash">bash shell</a> and do most of my work from there.  In fact, for the last several months I've been using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxbox">Fluxbox window manager</a>.  It provides very few graphical utilities, so I do most of my work from the command line.

Aside from the terminal, my favorite thing about linux in general and Ubuntu specifically is all the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open source software</a> that is available for it.  Everything running on the box right now is free/open source software.  It is awesome to watch how the open source community has made such great products.

Simply because of the way linux and other unixes (like <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>) are built, viruses and spyware are generally not a concern.  Security is much easier to maintain.  I don't even have any antivirus software on this box and have never had a problem.

One perpetual issue with linux is hardware support.  The built-in wireless card on my Compaq Presario laptop has never worked reliably, despite my earnest efforts.  But by and large, the default installation of Ubuntu 6.06 (the first version I used) found most of my hardware and made it work sufficiently well.  I'm using 7.04 now, and it all still runs great.

So as I was surfing today I found a few interesting items:
<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.ubuntustudio.com">Ubuntu Studio</a></strong> is an Ubuntu derivative targeted toward the multimedia guru.  Their first official release has just come out, based on Ubuntu 7.04.  I have a friend who is really into video and audio editing, but most of the software he uses is written only for Windows (except for <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The GIMP</a>, of course!).  This is a step in the right direction for linux to enter this market.  These blogs discuss Ubuntu Studio and may be of interest:

</ul>
EDIT: I also found the following two sites:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.blendernation.com/2007/05/12/ubuntu-studio-released/">BlenderNation</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.dvguru.com/2007/01/24/ubuntu-studio-announced-for-april/">DV Guru</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/05/01/13147.aspx">Dell is offering Ubuntu pre-installed on new systems</a></strong> This is another exciting step for linux entering the general consumer market.  Linux has long been the domain of the computer geek, but Ubuntu especially has made great progress in making linux accessible to the average human being.</li>
