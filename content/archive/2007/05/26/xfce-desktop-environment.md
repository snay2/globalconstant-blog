<p><a href="https://scnay-images.s3.amazonaws.com/globalconstant/xfce.png" title="screenshot2.png"><img src="https://scnay-images.s3.amazonaws.com/globalconstant/xfce_small.png" alt="screenshot2.png" align="right" /></a>I started using the <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a> desktop environment under Ubuntu the other day and have loved it so far.  <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> is a bit too heavyweight for me, so I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/">Fluxbox</a> for a few months.  It&rsquo;s lightning fast and really slick, but there&rsquo;s no eye candy whatsoever.</p>

<p>So the other day I decided to download Xfce and try it out.  It looks quite similar to GNOME but runs a lot faster.  It&rsquo;s much easier to customize than fluxbox and it supports my keyboard metakeys much better.  Plus the eye candy is great without taking too much toll on the speed.  I really like the themes, too.  (There are even some windows-esque ones.)  And everything runs just as well or better under Xfce as it did under fluxbox.</p>

<p>Another cool feature is the ability to create multiple &ldquo;sessions&rdquo; or startup profiles.  You can set Xfce to prompt you for which session you want when you log in.  So I can create one for play, one for work, and one with nothing special.</p>

<p>So there you have some ramblings about the wonders of Xfce.</p>
