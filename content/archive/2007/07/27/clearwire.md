My friend told me today about an Internet service called <a href="http://www.clearwire.com/">Clearwire</a> that his company is using. It's very intriguing.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwire">Clearwire</a> works by providing wireless Internet to users through structures similar to cell phone towers. Once the user sets up a special router, he can connect his computer or network to it in <a href="http://www.clearwire.com/support/networking.php">various ways</a>:
<ul>
	<li>Connect directly to the router</li>
	<li>Connect a conventional wired or wireless router to the Clearwire router</li>
	<li>Use ClearPlugs, which uses existing electrical outlets to send the signals</li>
</ul>
That last one is a bit baffling to me. Ethernet over electrical wiring? I haven't been able to find much information on it, although <a href="http://spongebopp.blogspot.com/2006/09/broadband-american-way.html">this blogger</a> says it isn't very reliable. Hmm.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwire#Services">Speeds on the service</a> are as high as 1.5 or 2 Mbps--certainly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband_Internet_access">much faster</a> than dial-up.

One advantage (or, some say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwire#Criticism">disadvantage</a>) is Clearwire's use of the licensed radio frequencies at 2.5 GHz. This makes it more secure than typical Wi-Fi, which uses unlicensed (and therefore more open but also more vulnerable) frequencies of 2.4 GHz. (Read the <a href="http://www.clearwire.com/support/faqs.php">FAQ</a> on their website, under About Clearwire.)
