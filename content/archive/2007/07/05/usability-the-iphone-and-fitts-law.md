I just read a <a href="http://www.humanized.com/weblog/2007/07/05/iphone_and_the_first_generation_woes/">great iPhone usability review</a> on the <a href="http://www.humanized.com/">Humanized</a> <a href="http://www.humanized.com/weblog/">Weblog</a>.  Interface design interests me, and Humanized has a ton of really cool ideas for creating humane, usable, intuitive interfaces.

Also on the post was a discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27_law">Fitt's law</a> and the way Apple designed multi-level lists on the system.  I found a link on the Wikipedia article to a Microsoft blog discussing the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/08/22/711808.aspx">implications of Fitt's law</a> in interface design for Windows and Microsoft Office.

Very interesting reads.
