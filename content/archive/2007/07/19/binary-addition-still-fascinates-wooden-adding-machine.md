I took the <a href="http://cs.byu.edu/courses/index.php?id=14&amp;info=1">Introduction to Computer Systems</a> class at BYU earlier this year and learned quite a lot about how computers work on the hardware and low-level software levels. One of the topics, of course, is binary arithmetic. I had a friend who loved to do binary addition on his hands. It always amazed me how quickly and accurately he did it.
