I read <a href="http://dmy999.com/article/23/the-curse-of-the-elegant-languages">this excellent post</a> on <a href="http://dmy999.com/">Derek Young's blog</a> today. In it he discusses the seeming paradox that elegant languages, such as Ruby and Haskell, are not as popular or widely used as the less elegant or plain ugly ones, like PHP and Perl. I found <a href="http://dmy999.com/article/23/the-curse-of-the-elegant-languages#c000041">Paul's comment</a> particularly insightful. And <a href="http://dmy999.com/article/23/the-curse-of-the-elegant-languages#c000039">rb's comment</a> was quite amusing--a good idea though probably impractical at present. At any rate, the post and discussion were very interesting to read.

As a side note, <a href="/2007/07/16/xmonad-the-mouseless-window-manager/">xmonad</a> was written in Haskell. So I've got a Haskell compiler now. Maybe I should start learning it... :)
