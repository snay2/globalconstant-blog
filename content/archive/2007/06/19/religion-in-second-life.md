Who'd a thunk it?

I just read a <a href="http://www.ldswebguy.com/2007/05/11/mormons-active-in-second-life/">post</a> on <a href="http://www.ldswebguy.com/">ldsWebguy's blog</a> about Mormons in <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>, an online virtual-reality world where users create avatars and live virtual lives.  Basically, a group of LDS users of Second Life have created a visitors center, meeting house, and a few other things to introduce others to the gospel.

I'm not sure that I agree with it, but it's interesting all the same.
