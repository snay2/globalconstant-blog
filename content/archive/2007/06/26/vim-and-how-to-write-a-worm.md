Being the computer geek I am, I found a few articles that are intriguing to the geeky mind.

On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_26">July 26, 1989</a>, Robert Morris, a student at Cornell, was indicted for releasing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm">Morris worm</a>.  This computer worm, one of the first ever created, played on several UNIX security vulnerabilities and infected thousands of computers once it was released. I found <a href="http://vxheavens.com/lib/ase01.html">an article</a> by University of Utah professor Donn Seeley, which describes how the worm was built. It was a fascinating read.

I also came across a few articles on <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, my favorite command-line text editor. It can do amazing things.  This website discusses <a href="http://jmcpherson.org/editing.html">using Vim efficiently</a>, <a href="http://jmcpherson.org/windows.html">working with multiple files</a>, and <a href="http://jmcpherson.org/vimrc.html">customizing the vimrc file</a>. I'm putting these links here mostly for my own benefit, but perhaps someone out there shares my love for Vim...
