"Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? / Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?" So wrote <a href="http://www.tech-samaritan.org/blog/2010/06/16/choruses-from-the-rock-t-s-eliot/">T. S. Eliot</a>. Technology puts in our hands a tremendous source of information. Google, for example, has obsoleted the pedantic memorization of facts. But that very technology we call a boon threatens to erode our knowledge in a flood of information, endangering the wisdom that arises from knowledge. Information, while a valuable tool, must not supplant introspection, synthesis, and learning; it should rather enhance them. Technology must not corrode intellectual development but empower it.
