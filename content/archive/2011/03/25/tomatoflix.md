How many times have you wanted to know the Rotten Tomatoes ratings for a movie you were considering at the Redbox?

Enter <a href="http://apps.kynetx.com/installable_apps/3459-TomatoFlix">TomatoFlix</a>.

I wrote an app using <a href="http://code.kynetx.com/">Kynetx</a> that takes advantage of the <a href="http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes API</a> and displays ratings on the movie detail pages of your favorite websites. Part of this I did for the <a href="http://code.kynetx.com/2011/03/07/developer-contest-win-an-ipad-2-with-mashery-kynetx-ends-mar-20th/">Kynetx developer contest</a> last week, but I didn't get very far. It only worked on Netflix, and it wasn't very pretty. Tonight I had some free time, so I improved the UI and added four more sites: IMDB, Redbox, Fandango, and Movies.com.

Here's what it looks like for <a href="imdb.com/title/tt0398286/">Tangled</a> on IMDB:

If you're a frequent moviegoer or movie renter, this is definitely worth checking out.
