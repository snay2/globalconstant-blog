I wrote a couple 140-character stories for one of the final assignments in CS 404 and found it quite a satisfying experience.

The first details one of the strange aspects of meeting in person for the first time someone you only "know" via Twitter:

<blockquote>He sat across the room, his face familiar, his voice strange. Despite resembling his avatar, this man could speak more than 140 characters.</blockquote>

The second deals with a theme I've pondered for quite a while---<a href="http://tweetagewasteland.com/2011/08/does-the-internet-make-you-more-connected/">living life through a screen</a>.

<blockquote>She danced gracefully while I watched through a 3.5" piece of glass. It's all in 1080p video, but I missed the higher-def live performance.</blockquote>
