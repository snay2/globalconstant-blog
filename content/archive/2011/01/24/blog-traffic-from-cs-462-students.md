I had some interesting traffic patterns on my blog over the past week and a half. I have <a href="/2011/01/07/building-up-an-ami-from-ubuntu-10-04-lts/">several</a> <a href="/2011/01/10/setting-up-my-development-environment-for-aws/">blog</a> <a href="/2011/01/14/helpful-links-for-lab-1/">posts</a> of considerable utility for the students in CS 462. Take a look at this pageview graph:

Luckily my hosting provider, <a href="http://www.asmallorange.com/">A Small Orange</a>, didn't have any trouble with the "spikes."
