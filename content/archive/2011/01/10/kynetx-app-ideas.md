This is largely a response to Mike Grace's post this morning about <a href="http://mikegrace.tumblr.com/post/2685369401/recent-kynetx-app-ideas-and-thoughts">some ideas he has for Kynetx apps</a>. The first few are my take on his ideas, and the rest are some of my own ideas.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Goodreads integration with LDS.org</strong> (from Mike) I really like this idea. I've been wanting to do some Kynetx apps with the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/api">Goodreads API</a> myself, such as an Amazon.com annotator to allow you to add books directly from there to your Goodreads shelves. However, due to some<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4556840/use-oauth-for-the-goodreads-api"> current limitations in KNS</a>, it doesn't seem like I can write an app that uses the necessary OAuth to talk to the API. Hopefully that will be implemented someday.</li>
	<li><strong>Google Reader suggestions</strong> (from Mike) I like this idea too. I have my own mental process for pruning out the articles that seem least relevant to me. But there's definitely an advantage to automating that. <a href="http://louisgray.com/">Louis Gray</a> and <a href="http://www.my6sense.com/">my6sense</a> have been doing some great work in that area. The problem is that I rarely read my RSS feeds on my phone, so I can't use any of their technology. I've also tried using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/pnngeaoibaajihakbnngcfecdkinjjpf">PostRank</a>, a Chrome plugin for Google Reader, but that isn't helpful in determining what's relevant to <em>me</em>. A Kynetx app would be the perfect solution.</li>
	<li><strong>Google Calendar/Twilio/email integration</strong> I wrote a bit about this one on Twitter a few months ago. My old boss wanted me to clock in within 15 minutes of my scheduled time every day. If there was ever a change to my schedule, he wanted an email informing him of such. I keep all that data up to date in a Google Calendar anyway, so I found it tedious to have to send him email as well. I'd like to build a Kynetx app that lets me watch my Google Calendar and send out notifications of various kinds (Twitter, SMS (Twilio), email, etc.) when something changes.</li>
	<li><strong>Twitter bot</strong> I have a Kindle, which has the ability to post my notes and annotations to Twitter and Facebook when I want. It has one problem, however. If I just highlight a piece of text that I want to share (quote, as it were), all it puts in the tweet is a link to view the quote on Amazon's site. I want to write a Kynetx app that watches my Twitter stream (or perhaps that of another account I own dedicated to my Kindle) that can then read the quote I posted and repost it in a more reader-friendly format. This would also be a nice way to send my Kindle annotations as quotes to Goodreads, something I currently cannot do.</li>
</ul>

There are some ideas. What do you think?
