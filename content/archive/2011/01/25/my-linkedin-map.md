<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2011/01/my_linkedin_map_visualizing_your_connections.shtml">Phil Windley</a> wrote earlier today that "LinkedIn Labs has released a <a href="http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/">visualization tool called an InMap</a>" and thought I would share mine.

The very well-connected lobe on the left contains mostly Kynetx employees, as well as people from a few other related companies like 7bound and MashWorx. These connections I largely gained last summer when I interned at Kynetx and did some independent consulting work.

The less well-connected lobe on the right is mostly people I know from BYU. There are several subgroups for the various places I've worked, such as the Office of Information Technology and Health and Human Performance Services. There are also a significant number of students I know; these tend to be the least inter-connected of all.

You can view my InMap in more detail <a href="http://inmaps.linkedinlabs.com/share/Steven_Nay/9188811787930787014133984914258994767">here</a>.
