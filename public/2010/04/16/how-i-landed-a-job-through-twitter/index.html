Read <a href="http://staynalive.com/articles/2009/11/18/kynetx-kills-the-portal-launches-identity-platform-for-developers/">this article</a> by Jesse Stay explaining why the current model of the web is broken and how Kynetx solves that problem: context-aware apps.</em></p>

<p>If you <a href="http://twitter.com/snay2">follow me</a> on Twitter, you will have seen <a href="http://twitter.com/snay2/status/12243550164">my recent tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>It's all but official now: I'm a new #Kynetx employee! This is gonna be awesome!</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a long and rewarding journey.</p>

<p>Several years ago, I started following <a href="http://www.windley.com/">Phil Windley&rsquo;s blog</a>. I don&rsquo;t even remember how I found it. It was either the fact that I listen to the <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/">IT Conversations podcast</a> (of which he is the executive producer), or that he&rsquo;s a <a href="http://cs.byu.edu/faculty/windley_phillip">BYU Computer Science professor</a> (where I go to school).</p>

<p>A little while after that, I left and <a href="http://instancevariable.wordpress.com/2007/05/31/belgium-and-the-netherlands/">went to Europe for two years</a>. When I came back, I <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2009/08/why_use_the_kynetx_rule_language_instead_of_javascript.shtml">learned</a> that Phil had started a company called <a href="http://www.kynetx.com/">Kynetx</a>. His posts hardly make any sense to me, but I kept reading to see what it was all about.</p>

<p>Around that same time, I also started <a href="http://twitter.com/windley">following him</a> on Twitter. (Before my two-year hiatus I had thought Twitter was a rather useless idea, but I decided to give it a try this time around. It was what all the cool kids were doing, after all.)</p>

<p>Every once in a while, I&rsquo;d retweet things Phil wrote. Eventually I guess he took notice of me and personally invited me to the inaugural <a href="http://code.kynetx.com/2009/11/20/kynetx-impact-conference-2009-highlights/">Kynetx Impact Conference</a> in Provo. I went. There was some pretty <a href="http://informationcard.net/card-projects/minuteman">mind-blowing</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=2956954&amp;id=100843423859">stuff</a> there.</p>

<p><a href="https://scnay-images.s3.amazonaws.com/globalconstant/bookcomparison.png"><img src="https://scnay-images.s3.amazonaws.com/globalconstant/bookcomparison.png" alt="" title="BookComparison" width="150" height="95" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-289"></a>I wrote a little &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; app but didn&rsquo;t do much else with Kynetx for a while. But I started following almost all of the employees on Twitter and became intrigued by all the cool stuff they were building. I started tweeting a lot about <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23kynetx">#Kynetx</a>. I even wrote <a href="/kynetx-apps/bookcomparison/">an app of my own</a>, which the Kynetx guys were kind enough to let me present at a <a href="http://code.kynetx.com/2010/03/17/kynetx-goes-back-to-school/">visit they made</a> to the BYU CS department.</p>

<p>It was quite apparent to me by now that Kynetx had taken note of me. But I never expected they would offer me a job. I was quite surprised when the VP of Developer Services called me up and invited me to their <a href="http://twitter.com/qwade/status/11457531851">customary Free Lunch Friday</a> for an interview. Soon thereafter, I was hired to join their <a href="http://www.jessiemorris.com/">two</a> <a href="http://www.alexkolson.com/">other</a> interns in the Lehi office.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been interesting to see how all of this grew out of my use of social media to follow the interesting things going on right around me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m reminded of Joel Spolsky&rsquo;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Gets-Things-Done-Technical/dp/1590598385/">Smart and Gets Things Done</a>. The best programmers don&rsquo;t have to go searching for jobs&ndash;the jobs come to them. I don&rsquo;t pretend to think that I&rsquo;m anything special as far as programmers go. But I can tell you that networking and effective use of social media can go a long way in advancing your career in the direction you want to take it.</p>
