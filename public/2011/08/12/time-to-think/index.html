                    <section>
                        <p>I recently read an article entitled <a href="http://www.openforum.com/articles/why-we-should-keep-wi-fi-off-airplanes" target="_blank">&ldquo;Why We Should Keep Wi-Fi Off Airplanes&rdquo;</a> by Scott Belsky. Here&rsquo;s what he said:
<blockquote>In the era of &ldquo;reactionary workflow,&rdquo; when we&rsquo;re always eager to react, respond, and surf the tops of our many feeds and inboxes, we seldom start a thought on our own. We don&rsquo;t disconnect for long enough to really think organically, without interruption.</p>

<p>In an era where most thoughts are prompted by a stimulus of the hyper-connected-twitter-e-mail kind, we seldom disconnect long enough to think organicallyâ€”independent of the stuff we are reacting to.</blockquote>
I&rsquo;ve pondered this problem before. One of the things I loved when I <a href="/2010/02/13/palm-pre-plus-vs-iphone-os/" target="_blank">first got a smartphone</a> was the constant connectivity, no matter whether I was in Wi-Fi range or not. I received emails within minutes of their being sent. Twitter mentions got my immediate attention. Even Facebook notifications came to my home screen. It was great.</p>

<p>Then several months ago, I decided to switch back to a dumbphone and use my iPod Touch for everything else. The thing I loved about the switch was how liberated I felt. No longer was I always connected, with emails and tweets constantly clamoring for my attention. Even when I was in Wi-Fi range, those things weren&rsquo;t nearly as intrusive. It was wonderful. I could live life disconnected when I wanted to.</p>

<p>One thing I appreciate about religion is the invitation to ponder, meditate, and think. Without that, I would be running around constantly connected and never stopping to think for myself or enjoy life for its own sake. That has become such an important thing for me that I try to devote an entire day to it once a week. Sunday is a welcome break from the noise and distraction of the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Technology has allowed us humans to connect in many ways that were never possible before. But the most fulfilling interactions still come in old-fashioned ways&ndash;talking face to face, doing things together, enjoying nature or the arts. Those things prompt independent, &ldquo;organic&rdquo; thought, as Scott calls it. That is critical to our functioning as humans.</p>

<p>I disagree that it means we need to keep Wi-Fi off planes. Instead, the desire for thought and meditation ought to be an intrinsic motivator itself that guides us to give it priority.</p>

<p>EDIT (17 Aug 2011): Dave Pell wrote a post today entitled <a href="http://tweetagewasteland.com/2011/08/does-the-internet-make-you-more-connected/">&ldquo;Does the Internet Make You More Connected?&rdquo;</a> that I highly recommend. It fits nicely with my thoughts here.</p>
